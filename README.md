# FoodMood

# At a glance:
FoodMood allows a user to record and monitor the impact certain foods has on not only their physical, but also their emotional state. It is a tool designed to assist any  user to navigate their emotional relationship with food. 

# How it works:
A user will log their food intake as well as how it makes them feel at the time of eating. The user can then log their physical or emotional state at a later time. This data will be recorded and displayed in a way that allows the user to easily identify trends, tendencies and patterns in relation to the foods they consume.

# Additional information:
The question that this app allows users to ask themselves is "How does food truly make me feel?"  

That bitter gourd may be fantstic for your blood sugar levels, but not worth the misery of eating it.
That fried chicken may make have you head over heels as you're eating it, but leaves you feeling bloated and tired an hour later.

The objective of this app is to allow users to navigate their relationship with food away from calories, diets and food fads. The aim is to enhance a user's own ability to eat intuitively, according to what makes them feel good not only physically, but emotionally. Because food should be medicine... not only for the body but also for the soul.
