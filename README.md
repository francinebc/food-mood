# FoodMood

# At a glance:
FoodMood allows a user to record and monitor the impact certain foods has on their emotional state. It is a tool designed to assist any  user to navigate their emotional relationship with food. 

# How it works:
A user will log their food intake as well as how it makes them feel at the time of eating. The user can then log their emotional state at a later time. This data will be recorded and displayed in a way that allows the user to easily identify trends, tendencies and patterns in their emotional state in relation to the foods they consume.

# Additional information:
The question that this app allows users to ask themselves is "Are you eating for joy?" Eating for joy might not be attached to the food itself, but also the context within its consumption, amongst family and friends. Eating gives us sustenance and strength, but it can be so much more. It can be the social glue that brings people together. It is a means for sharing culture. Breaking bread is a symbol of love and unity. 

Much of diet culture ignores the very basis of eating. The humanity of food.

The objective of this app is to allow users to navigate their relationship with food away from calories, diets and food fads. The aim is to enhance a user's ability to eat intuitively, according to what makes them feel good not only physically, but emotionally. Because food should spark joy (Shameless Marie Kondo reference).
